/**
 * Compiles or extracts the compendium packs declared in module.json with the Foundry VTT CLI.
 *
 *   npm run pack     # packs/_source/<name>/*.json -> LevelDB at each pack's `path`
 *   npm run unpack   # LevelDB at each pack's `path` -> packs/_source/<name>/*.json
 *
 * Only the JSON source is committed. The LevelDB packs are build output: the release workflow
 * compiles them, and locally Foundry reads and writes them. After editing a compendium in
 * Foundry, close the world (LevelDB opens in one process at a time) and run `unpack` before
 * committing; after pulling, run `pack`.
 *
 * Both directions start from an empty destination, so a document deleted on one side does not
 * linger on the other.
